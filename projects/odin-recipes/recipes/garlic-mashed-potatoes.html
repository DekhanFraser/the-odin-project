        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These garlic mashed potatoes are rich and very tasty! For a creamier texture, use heavy cream in place of the milk.
             These are also terrific topped with sesame seeds or green onions.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 ½-inch pieces</li>
            <li>5 large garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>¾ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine potatoes, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of the salt in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high.
                 Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
                </li>
            <li>
                Drain potatoes and return to hot saucepan. Stir until dry, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add butter, 1 piece at a time, stirring gently until melted before the next addition. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a potato masher, mash in milk until smooth. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and white pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer potatoes to a serving bowl and top with more butter, if desired.
            </li>
        </ol>
